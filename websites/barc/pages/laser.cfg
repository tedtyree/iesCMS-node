<p>LASER was first described by Albert Einstein in 1914. Since then, this technology has been evolving into a variety of applications. Medical uses include the use of both surgical lasers (hot lasers) and therapy lasers (cold lasers).</p>

<p><strong>What is low level LASER Therapy?</strong> Low Level LASER Therapy, commonly known as LLLT (also cold laser or soft laser) is a form of phototherapy which involves the application of monochromatic and coherent light to injuries and lesions to stimulate healing.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is LLLT used for?</strong> LLLT is used to increase the speed, quality and strength of tissue repair, resolve inflammation and give pain relief. Cold LASER Therapy can be use to treat muscles, tendons, ligaments, bone, skin and nervous tissues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong> The effects of LLLT are photochemical and photomechanical, not thermal. Therefore, there are no risks of heat or thermal burns from cold lasers. Photons enter the tissue and are absorbed in the mitochondria and at the cell membrane by photoreceptive molecules called chromophores. Photonoic energy is converted to chemical energy (ATP) within the cell and is utilized in the form of ATP. This ATP energy helps to improve many cell functions including cell division and repair. This, in turn, helps to stimulate the immune system, improve the release of important chemicals and hormones. All of these processes help to generate new tissues and improve healing.<br />
