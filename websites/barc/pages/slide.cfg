<p>The explanation for how this works varies. In Eastern medicine, the thought is that acupuncture stimulates the flow of Chi and restores the balance of yin and yang. It is from this imbalance that disease and painful syndromes evolve.</p>
<p>In a Western frame of mind, the insertion of the needles stimulates local physiological reactions (vasodilation, release of cytokines, etc) as well as a systemic response (release of endorphins, hormones and naturally occurring steroids, as well as inhibition of pain nerves).</p>
<p>Acupuncture can be very effective in treating acute and chronic pain in animals. It is useful for helping to reduce the amount of pain medication necessary to provide a high quality of life for our pets that have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Undergone surgery</li>
    <li>Arthritis and old age changes</li>
    <li>Intervertebral disc problems.</li>
    <li>Treating chronic skin issues</li>
    <li>Allergies</li>
    <li>Certain metabolic diseases</li>
</ul>
