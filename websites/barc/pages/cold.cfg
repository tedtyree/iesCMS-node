<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Cryotherapy is the therapeutic application of cold (such as ice), while thermotherapy is the therapeutic application of heat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">&bull; <em><strong>Cryotherapy</strong></em> is used during the acute phase of tissue injury and healing to mitigate the effects of tissue injury and after exercise to minimize adverse secondary inflammatory responses. Cryotherapy reduces blood flow, causes vasoconstriction, decreases sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity, provides analgesia, and helps prevent trauma-induced edema.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&bull; <em><strong>Thermotherapy</strong></em> is used in rehabilitation for its hemo-dynamic, neuromuscular, metabolic, and connective-tissue effects. Heat is most appropriately applied after the acute inflammatory phase of tissue healing has resolved. Heat therapy increases vasodilatation, increases blood flow, accelerates tissue healing, relaxes muscles, and increases connective tissue extensibility.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thermal heat therapy and use of cold packs play an important part in the successful rehabilitation of musculoskeletal injuries in pets. Superficial heat packs, cold-compressions, ice massage, and special custom wraps are used to make sure your pet receives the maximum benefits of this therapy.</span></p>
