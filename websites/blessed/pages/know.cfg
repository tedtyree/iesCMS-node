<p><strong>Presently, Kenya&rsquo;s Kids enriches the lives of hundreds of children, as well as families and communities, with food, clothing, education, and the love of God.</strong></p>

<p>People throughout the rural areas live in extreme poverty. Many are unable to feed their families as the region is frequently threatened by drought. Many children do not have even one meal per day. Infant mortality is high, addictions to drugs and alcohol are prevalent, HIV and AIDS is widespread, and political unrest and violence is an ongoing concern. Often, children as young as 5 or 6 years old are at risk of being sent to the streets because the family doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to feed, clothe, educate, or care for their basic needs. Kenyan law requires that students wear uniforms, a major obstacle for poor families seeking education for their children, and higher education is generally considered to be out of reach.</p>

<p>You can offer &ldquo;hope and a future&rdquo; to Kenya&rsquo;s Kids through sponsorship and involvement.</p>

	<li>Mbooni Children&rsquo;s Home: Managed by Reverend Benjamin and Esther Kamende</li>
</ul>

<p>In cooperation with the local schools, we have instituted a community feeding program. Together, we provide a meal to each student who would not receive one otherwise. We provide uniforms and cover the fees for our children to attend primary and secondary school. They also receive additional instruction and assistance in the Homes.</p>
</div>

<div id="tabs-2">
<p>We provide food supplements, health care, educational sponsorship (including uniforms and shoes), and spiritual care to families at risk living in the Ngelani area. This program allows us to impact children, who are the fabric of the community, while allowing them to remain in their families.</p>
</div>

<div id="tabs-3">
<p>We are grateful for our partnership with the Africa Inland Church, which multiplies and expands the outreach and support we can provide into the rural regions of Kenya.</p>

<p>Pastor Larry Cook has conducted numerous Pastoral Leadership training seminars, reaching thousands of pastors in the Machakos region where we serve together, continuing to bring the word of God to areas and people yet unreached in Kenya.</p>

<p>Pastor Larry Cook of Immanuel Church in Lansdale Pennsylvania befriended Simon and Purity Kiruri, a couple from Naivasha, Kenya who were students at Hatfield Bible College.</p>

<p>The Kiruris had established Evelyn Memorial Compassionate Ministry to serve the &ldquo;street children&rdquo; of Kenya. Through the grace of God and the sponsorships of Immanuel Church and other organizations, the mission soon grew to serve more than 200 children.</p>

<p>Our leadership team visits Mbooni Children&rsquo;s home in the Machakos area for the first time. Impressed with the leadership of Rev. Benjamin Kamende and his staff, a new partnership and a new name, &ldquo;Kenya&rsquo;s Kids,&rdquo; was established, along with a new alliance with the Africa Inland Church in the Machakos area of Kenya.</p>

<p>Beginning with a single home with 43 children, we soon had more than 130 children in our care. Momentum has built ever since, now serving hundreds of children and their families through our homes and our rural development center, as well as with our community outreach initiatives.</p>

<p>Becaues of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Kenyan President declared closure of all children's homes. Any child with a legal guardian was required to return to that home.  Our Kenya's Kids staff are continuing to check in with and provide for the needs of these children. Children who did not have a guardian remained at Mbooni Children's Home.</p>
