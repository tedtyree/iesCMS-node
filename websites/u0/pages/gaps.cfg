		<h1 class='bodyMainHeading'>Biggest Gaps</h1>
		<div class="col-12 m-5">
			<p>For the past two years our small team has been learning about business best practices and talking with business owners in the local Machakos area to assess the needs and challenges that they face. Here are some of the top challenges and gaps we have discovered so far in our research:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Shortage of reliable employees</li>
			<li>Unwillingness to share knowledge (Demming concept)</li>
			<li>Business leadership that is not helping their employees grow or obtain a sustainable level of pay.</li>
			<li>Everyone wants to start their own business. Lack of working together to leverage invidual strengths as a team that is stronger together.</li>
			<li>Use of technology - Technology seems to be present, but is not being leveraged to add value to business practices</li>
			</ul>
